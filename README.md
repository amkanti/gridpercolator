# gridpercolator

Percolation threshold( via Monte Carlo simulation)
=========================================================================

Checks if a randomly distributed grid with blocked sites percolates i.e determines the least number of open
  sites required for the system to percolate and computes the threshold value. It also determines the mean, standard deviation of percolation threshold and also the confidence interval.
